<h1>Why should I join?</h1>
<p>If you ever wanted to make a game but can't figure out how, you can create a game whether it be with your friends, by yourself, or meet other people and make a new team. And if you are feeling reluctant you can still give it a go.</p>

<h1>What can I do? Do I need experience?</h1>
<p>If you have prior experience that's great, feel free to show us your portfolio. However <strong>you don't need experience </strong> to join. Game design is <strong>broad,</strong> including roles such as 
<span style='color:red;'> programming & coding </span>,  
<span style='color:#9900FF;'>digital art & animation</span>, 
<span style='color:#00C800'>music & soundtrack composing</span>, 
<span style='color:#00AFFF'>and level design & brainstorming.</span> </p><p>
We create games in teams to compete in events such as gamejams. <em> Game jams are competitions where you create a game in a given timeframe inspired by a theme.</em> Check out gamejams at <a href="https://itch.io/jams">Itch.io</a>.</p><p> You can also work on your own projects that aren't involved in gamejams, whether solo or with a team. This game design club is just here to share ideas, give feedback, and help find those nasty bugs in your game <em>If you encounter any and can't figure out how to solve them.</em></p>
